I am a Computer Scientist at the Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), California. My main area of research is high-performance computing (HPC); my main sub-area of research in HPC is programing models and systems. I’m particularly interested in program analysis, software correctness, testing, debugging, emerging programming models, and fault tolerance. I develop practical tools that allow scientific programmers improve the reliability, correctness, and accuracy of their codes. To develop these tools, I usually rely on compiler instrumentation, low-level binary instrumentation, static analysis, dynamic analysis, and machine learning. I co-organize the International Workshop on Software Correctness for HPC Applications (Correctness), which has been held at SC for several years. I'm the recipient of the ACM/IEEE-CS George Michael Fellowship in 2014, the Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship in 2019, and the Hans Meuer Award for best research paper at ISC’19. I'm an IEEE Senior Member.
