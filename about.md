I am a Computer Scientist at the Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), California. My main area of research is high-performance computing (HPC); my main sub-area of research in HPC is programing models and systems. I’m in particular interested in fault tolerance, fault resilience, debugging, software correctness and general software reliability. I develop practical tools that allow scientific programmers improve the reliability and accuracy of their codes. To develop these tools, I usually rely on compiler instrumentation (with LLVM), low-level binary instrumentation, static analysis, dynamic analysis, and machine learning. I'm an IEEE Senior Member.
