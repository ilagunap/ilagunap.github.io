Are you interested on an internship at LLNL? Would like to work on a challenging research problem on programming systems or runtime systems with applications to HPC and/or scientific computing?

If so, please contact me (ilaguna@llnl.gov). You can apply directly to the Computation Internships Program [here](https://computation.llnl.gov/careers/internships).

Broadly speaking, I am interested in the following areas of research as they apply to HPC / scientific computing:

- Debugging (automatically preferably) HPC and scientific programs
- Reducing the accuracy of numerical computations to improve performance
- General static and dynamic analysis for floating-point computations
- Compiler analysis using LLVM (e.g., via instrumentation) to improve performancce/reliability
- Fault tolerance and reliability of HPC systems and applications

### Deadline: Jan/11/2018
